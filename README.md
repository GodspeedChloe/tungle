# tungle
an open-source tumblr clone

## Why

Let's face it - Tumblr probably won't be around forever.  So why not build an open-source Tumblr clone?

## Tech

We'll be using Rails 5.0 and Postgresql.  Other stuff in the stack is yet to be decided.

## Goals

- [ ] Create userblogs
- [ ] add ability to like posts / reblog posts
- [ ] rich text / markdown editor
- [ ] user themes
- [ ] API utilizing OAuth 2.0
- [ ] Messages & inbox (probably should be consolidated somehow)
- [ ] More stuff to come
